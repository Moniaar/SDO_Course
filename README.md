My notes taken upon the Stanford Data Ocean scholarship

To find a command or any shortcut in Jupyter just type H in any cell that doesn't have code inside ;).

## General Notes:
<h3>Python</h3>
> :memo: **Note:**
1. Floor division: returns only the whole part following division
2. When you divide any two numbers, even if they are integers that result in a whole number, youâ€™ll always get a float
3. When you mix an integer and a float in an operation, Python will always return a float
4. If an apostrophe is used, then double quotes are required.
5. Python keeps track of the variable changes even if you changed its value after initilization
6. Python is case senstive btw
7. As a convenience in Python, you can assign values to multiple variables at the same time, using just one line of code. This is known in Python as "unpacking".
