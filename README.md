My notes taken upon the Stanford Data Ocean scholarship

To find a command or any shortcut in Jupyter just type H in any cell that doesn't have code inside ;).

## General Notes:
<h3>Python</h3>
1. Floor division: returns only the whole part following division
2. When you divide any two numbers, even if they are integers that result in a whole number, youâ€™ll always get a float
3. When you mix an integer and a float in an operation, Python will always return a float
