My notes taken upon the Stanford Data Ocean scholarship

`To find a command or any shortcut in Jupyter just type H in any cell that doesn't have code inside ;).`

## General Notes:
<h3>Python</h3>
> :memo: **Note:**
1. Floor division: returns only the whole part following division
2. When you divide any two numbers, even if they are integers that result in a whole number, youâ€™ll always get a float
3. When you mix an integer and a float in an operation, Python will always return a float
4. If an apostrophe is used, then double quotes are required.
5. Python keeps track of the variable changes even if you changed its value after initilization
6. Python is case senstive btw
7. As a convenience in Python, you can assign values to multiple variables at the same time, using just one line of code. This is known in Python as "unpacking", This will work as long as the number of values matches the number of variables.
8. It is a good practice in python to assign constants values to capital string names
9. You can convert a value to become an integer by wrapping the value inside the int() function. This is known as casting
10. String comparison can be useful, for example, when comparing if the text a person entered is equaivalent to the saved password.
11. You can make lists inside other lists
12. Using -1 as the index position always returns the last item in a list
13. Simplest way to add a new element to a list is to use the append() method
14. You can remove an item from a list by using the del statement.  All del needs is the name of the list and the element's index position that you would like remove
15. Slicing doesn't include last position in the list
16. The end of the range() is excluded
17. The range() function generates a list of numbers, but the numbers don't have to be used within the for loop
